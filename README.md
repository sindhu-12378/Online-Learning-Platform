Task Description :This project involved the design and development of a fully functional Online Learning Platform created using core frontend technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The task required building a complete and responsive webpage that introduces students to the basics of the web through an embedded educational YouTube video. The platform includes a clean and structured layout built with HTML, featuring dedicated sections for navigation, course content, a learning video, an interactive quiz, a progress tracker, and a login module. CSS was used extensively to enhance the visual appearance of the platform, implementing modern styling techniques such as responsive grid layouts, soft shadows, rounded components, hover effects, and balanced spacing to ensure a smooth and user-friendly experience across devices. JavaScript was used to add logical interactivity, including input validation for the student login system, dynamic quiz checking with real-time messages, and a progress bar that visually updates upon answering correctly. The task specifically aimed to demonstrate essential web development concepts—structuring content, designing intuitive interfaces, and implementing dynamic behavior—while delivering an educational experience that teaches what the web is, why it is important, and the key features of web applications. This project showcases strong understanding of frontend development, UI design, problem-solving, and the ability to integrate media and interactivity into a cohesive, functional learning platform.
